The elimination halflife (t~) of caffeine was determined by regression analysis from the linear terminal part of the semilogarithrnic presentation of the caffeine concentration-time curve. The volume of distribution (V~) was calculated according to: Vc = D/C0 where D is the dose of caffeine administered and C0 is the serum concentration obtained from extrapolation to time zero.
